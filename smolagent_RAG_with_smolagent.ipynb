        "Alfred, your trusted agent, is preparing for the most extravagant gala of the century. To ensure the event runs smoothly, Alfred needs quick access to up-to-date information about each guest. Let‚Äôs help Alfred by creating a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool, powered by our custom dataset.\n",
